# Java Light Order Matching Engine
A Java implementation of [gavincyi/LightMatchingEngine](https://github.com/gavincyi/LightMatchingEngine)

## Disclaimer
I'm just getting into the world of OMEs, ECNs and other trading-related systems, just for fun.
I found [gavincyi's Python implementation](https://github.com/gavincyi/LightMatchingEngine) and, after a bit of trubble with Python networking, I decided to port it to a language where I would have an easier time with sockets and websockets.
Just to be clear, **THIS IS NOT A COPY, NOR A ONE-TO-NE REPLICA OF THE ORIGINAL**. It has its own quarks and it's written in a fairly different manner, but it uses the same algorithm and presents a similar interface to the user.

## Build
JLOME uses Maven as its build system. Though you should be able to build it without maven as its not a complex codebase and has no external dependencies.
